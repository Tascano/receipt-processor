```

Activate the virtual environment. The command to activate the virtual environment varies depending on your operating system:

For Windows (Command Prompt):
```
$ venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

For Windows (PowerShell):
```
$ venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
For macOS/Linux:
```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

## To run a server 
$uvicorn main:app --reload


## To stop a running server 

To stop a running uvicorn server started with the `uvicorn main:app --reload` command, you can use one of the following methods:

1. Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running. This will send a KeyboardInterrupt signal, causing the server to stop gracefully.

2. If you are running the server in the background or in a separate terminal session, you can find the process ID (PID) of the uvicorn process and terminate it using the appropriate command for your operating system.

   - On Unix/Linux:
     - Use the `ps` command to list the running processes and find the PID of the uvicorn process:
       ```bash
       ps aux | grep uvicorn
       ```
     - Once you have the PID, use the `kill` command followed by the PID to terminate the process:
       ```bash
       kill <PID>
       ```

   - On Windows:
     - Use the `tasklist` command to list the running processes and find the PID of the uvicorn process:
       ```bash
       tasklist | findstr "uvicorn"
       ```
     - Once you have the PID, use the `taskkill` command followed by the PID to terminate the process:
       ```bash
       taskkill /PID <PID>
       ```

Choose the method that is most convenient for you to stop the uvicorn server.
